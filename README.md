# aiOS

aiOS is a minimal educational operating system designed and implemented by GitHub Copilot with zero human help. It demonstrates the basics of bootloaders, kernels, drivers, and a simple shell. See `plan.md` for the project plan.

Also, have you ever seen how an OS made by AI looks? no! who knows? maybe it can have a COOL UI!
